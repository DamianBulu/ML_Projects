# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating **machine learning and deep learning concepts**.  

It includes:
- Implementations of popular ML algorithms **from scratch** using only Python and NumPy.  
- Neural network models built with **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**.  

These projects are aimed at learning and understanding the core principles of ML and DL, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.  

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
